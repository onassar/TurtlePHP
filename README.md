TurtlePHP
===

TurtlePHP is a PHP MVC-based framework. I use the word framework loosely, as it
contains very few binding features, and uses a minimalistic approach to make
development within it easy and natural (for PHP developers, that is).

### MVC flow
 - Data access ought to be managed through a corresponding object&#039;s model
 - Output of a request out to contained within a view
 - Business/middleware logic ought to be managed through a controller

### Buffer control
 - 

### Error/exception handling
### Dynamic routing
### Tiny footprint (8 files, &lt;35kb)
